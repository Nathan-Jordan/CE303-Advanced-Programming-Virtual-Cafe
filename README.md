# CE303-Advanded-Programming-Virtual-Cafe
Implementation of a "Virtual Cafe" using a client-server architecture in Java.<br>
Full specification can be seen in VirtualCafe.html<br>

**Mark:** 100<br>

**Feedback:** Everything worked perfectly, you had great quality code, excellent user interface in both client and server, and the odd bug that I worked VERY hard to uncover (e.g. "order -1 teas").
